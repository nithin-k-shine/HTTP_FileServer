The HTTP protocol is used to share a directory in our laptop to all the devices in the network. After running the following python code, a port number will be displayed 
in the terminal that you need to open in your phone’s browser along with the IP address of 
your laptop (http://ip_address:port_number). Now as soon as the phone is connected, you can 
upload files from your phone directly into your laptop’s directory without internet connection.
